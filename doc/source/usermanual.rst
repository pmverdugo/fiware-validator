An OpenStack validator for the deployment of chef cookbooks implemented as
a service with an OpenStack-native Rest API

External Dependencies

The dependency list reads as follows:

- OpenStack Keystone server:
    Used for issuing user tokens for several OpenStack services

- Docker daemon:
    Used to deploy the test images

Installation
------------

Please, consult the installation and admin guide for details on installation, deployment and testing.

Configuration

All the system behaviour can be controlled by modifying the configuration files.
The system-wide configuration is accessible in etc/validator/validator.conf
A default configuration is provided for ease of usage, but it can be customized as desired by modifying said file.

Programmer Guide

Validation Process
------------------

The cookbook validation process consists on the following steps:

1. The **Client** sends a POST request to the service API, containing:
    - The name of the cookbook to be tested
    - The *Github* repository from which to obtain the cookbook
    - The virtual machine name for deployment
2. The **Server** receives the request and takes the following steps:
    - Checks the user permissions to take the next steps by validating against Keystone
    - Downloads the needed *cookbook*
    - Deploys the selected *Virtual Machine* image
    - Instructs the **Chef Server** to deploy the *cookbook* in the given *Virtual Machine*
    - Responds to the **Client** request informing of the status of the validation process

Translating
===========

The system uses the default locale en_US. To generate stubs for translating to another languages, a custom script is provided in:
::

    ./tools/generatemessages.[bat|sh]

Changing the extension based on your os of choice.
This will generate a locale folder with the default strings and subfolders for each available locale.
